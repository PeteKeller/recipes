Marinated London Broil

London Broil

Meat Tenderizer
2 TBSP - Minced Dried Onion
1 TSP - Marjoram
1 Cup - Red Wine Vinegar
3 TBSP - Lemon Juice
2 TSP - Thyme
1 Bay Leaf - Crushed
1/2 Cup - Oil

Pierce steak with fork and sprinkle with Meat Tenderizer, flip over and repeat.

Combine rest of items into a marinade. Marinate the meat for at least 4-5 hours. We like to freeze them together which really draws the marinade into the meat.

Grill about 6 inches above flame until desired doneness.
