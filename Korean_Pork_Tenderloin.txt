Korean Pork Tenderloin

TON-YUK-KUI (Korean pork)
1 1/2 lbs. pork tenderloin (Boneless Skinless Chicken breasts work as good as Pork Tenderloin
2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped (Garnish)

Marinade
1/2 cup soy sauce (I use low sodium soy sauce)
1/4 cup water 
3 tablespoons sugar 
2 green onions 
2 cloves garlic, diced 
1 teaspoon fresh ginger, chopped 
Dash freshly ground black pepper

Slice meat into 1/2-inch medallions. (NOTE: I cut into 1/2-inch cubes)

Combine with marinade for two hours. 

Remove and dry on paper towels, saving the marinade.

Coat a baking dish with 2 tablespoons of sesame or olive oil. Arrange pork in dish. Pour over marinade.

NOTE: If you cube the meat, don't bother with the drying on paper towels, just Pam the baking dish and pour it in.  Stir between 20 and 30 minutes to ensure all are kept moist.

Bake covered at 350 degrees for 1 hour or until meat is tender. 
Arrange slices on a bed of cooked rice. 
Pour hot cooking liquid over top, garnish with parsley and serve.

Makes 3 to 4 servings.
