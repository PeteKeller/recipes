Golden Sesame Braid

1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water (110 to 115 degrees)
1 1/2 cups warm milk (110 to 115 degrees)
1/4 cup shortening (I used butter flavored Crisco)
1/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon salt
4 eggs
7 to 8 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon cold water
2 tablespoons sesame seeds

    In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water.  Add the milk, shortening, sugar, salt, 3 eggs, and 4 cups flour.  Beat until smooth.  Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.  Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes.  Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top.     Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.  Punch dough down.  Turn onto a lightly floured surfaced; *divide in half.  Divide each portion into thirds.  Shape each piece into a 12-inch rope.  Place three ropes on a greased baking pan; braid.  Pinch ends to seal and tuck under.  Repeat with remaining dough. cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.  Beat remaining egg and cold water; brush over braids.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown.  Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.  Yield:  2 loves.

For Sun Shape

     *Take about 1/4 to 1/3 of dough and form into a flattened ball.  Take remainder of dough and form into a fat cylinder.  Flatten and cut into eight triangles. I had a small amount left over for Birdie to make her moon with.  Attach the rays with the egg wash, then egg wash the whole loaf and sprinkle with the sesame  seeds, or not, if you are Angel.  Allow to rise and bake as described above (it took a little over 35 minutes in my oven for this larger loaf, which I baked on a pizza pan.)
