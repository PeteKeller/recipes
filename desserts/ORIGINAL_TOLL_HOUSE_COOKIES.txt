ORIGINAL TOLL HOUSE COOKIES
(Classic chocolate chip drop cookies)

1 c (2 sticks) butter
3/4 c sugar
3/4 c firmly packed brown sugar
1 t vanilla
1 t baking soda
1 t salt
2 eggs (large or extra large)
2 1/4 c flour
1 12 ounce bag Nestle Toll House Semi-Sweet Chocolate Morsels (I use a mix of 1/2 semi-sweet and 1/2 milk chocolate)
1 c chopped nuts (I omit theses)
Cream butter, add sugars and beat until fluffy.  Add vanilla, salt and baking soda and mix well.  Add eggs and vanilla, mix well again, then start gradually adding flour.  Once flour is fully incorporated, add chocolate chips and nuts (if using.)  Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookies sheets.  Bake at 375 for 8-10 minutes.
The book also offers the option of baking them as bar cookies:  spread dough into 15x10x1 cookie sheet, bake at 375 for 20 minutes.  When I did this, I like them in the next size cookie sheet down, for a softer, thicker cookie.
