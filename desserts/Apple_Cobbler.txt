Apple Cobbler

2 cans pie filling (I use the Comstock More Fruit Cinnamon and Spice Apple, but you can use any fruit you like)
1 box Jiffy Cake mix, yellow (I have tried this with other cake mixes, and it just doesn't taste as good.)
1 stick butter, melted

Spray an 8 X 8 or 9 X 9 glass baking dish with non-stick spray (Pam.)  Dump in the pie filling.  Sprinkle cake mix on top, covering pie filling as completely as you can, then pour melted butter over cake mix.  Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes to an hour (keep your nose alert--when you can smell it, it is almost done.)  Let stand for 5 or 10 minutes, then serve.  Top with ice cream, if desired.

You can double this, and put in a 9 X 13 for a larger group.

I usually put this in as we sit down to dinner, so it is ready about the time the dinner dishes get done--and the smell is great inspiration to get them done!
