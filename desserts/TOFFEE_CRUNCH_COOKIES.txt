TOFFEE CRUNCH COOKIES

(A drop cookie, looks almost like a chocolate chip cookie missing the chips.  One of Dad's favorites!)
1 c (2 sticks) butter
1/2 c sugar
1 c firmly packed brown sugar
1 t vanilla
2 t cream of tartar
1/2 salt
1 t baking soda
2 eggs (large or extra large)
2 T milk
2 1/2 c flour
1 bag toffee bits (Heath bits, usually in the baking aisle)

Cream butter, add sugars, then egg, milk and vanilla until fluffy.  Add cream of tartar, baking soda and salt.  Add the flour 1 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. Finally add toffee bits.  Drop by teaspoonfuls onto parchment-lined baking sheets.  Bake at 375 for 7-9 minutes, or until golden brown.
