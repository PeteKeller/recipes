BUTTER BALLS

(Round, white cookies)
1 cup  (2 sticks) butter
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1/2 t vanilla
1 3/4 cup flour
1/2 cup chopped nuts (I use walnuts)
additional powdered sugar to roll cookies in after they bake

Cream butter, add sugar and beat until light and fluffy.  Blend in vanilla and gradually add flour.  Add nuts.  (Book suggests chilling for ease in handling, but I use a small ice-cream-style scoop, so it is easier for me to work the dough right away.)  Form 1-inch balls.  Bake for 20 minutes at 350 degrees.  Roll in powdered sugar as soon as they come out of the oven, then cool on wire rack.  (I find that wearing gloves-like doctors wear-makes it easier to handle the hot cookies without burning myself.)
