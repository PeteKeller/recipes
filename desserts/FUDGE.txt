FUDGE

1 12 ounce can condensed milk--NOT sweetened condensed, may also be called evaporated milk
4 1/2 c sugar
1/2 lb (2 sticks) butter
1 13 ounce jar marshmallow creme (Kraft comes in this size; if you can't find it, you will have to weigh it out of other-sized jars)
2 lb milk chocolate, melted
approx. 1 t vanilla
chopped nuts, to taste, optional
Put first three ingredients in large pot, bring to boil and boil 5 minutes.  Add the marshmallow, chocolate and vanilla.  This will take a strong arm and LOTS of stirring to combine thoroughly.  Add nuts, if desired, then pour into large pan (like a 9x13 glass baking dish or two) to cool and set.  You can also pour some out into one container, then add nuts to the remainder so you have some with nuts and some without.
