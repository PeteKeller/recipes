Grasshopper Cake

White cake mix
Substitute green Creme de Menthe for 3 Tablespoons of the water, and bake as directed.
I make a 9 X 13

When cool, frost with chocolate frost--I use the store bought kind, 1 can.

Take 1 regular container of Cool Whip (not the huge one) and add Creme de Menthe to taste and color, then spread over the top of the chocolate frosting.

You could do this as a layer cake if you wanted, maybe put the frosting between the layers and on top, then the Cool Whip on top and sides, but I like leaving it in my covered 9 X 13 pan, as CAKE MUST STAY REFRIGERATED.
