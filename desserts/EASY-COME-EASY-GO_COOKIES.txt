EASY-COME-EASY-GO COOKIES

(kind of funny looking, rectangular with nuts on top)
approx. 40 graham cracker quarters (Keebler grahams break nicely, if you want pretty cookies)
1 stick butter
1 stick margarine
1/2 c sugar
2/3 c finely chopped nuts (again, I use walnuts)
Spread crackers in single layer in an 11 1/2 x 17 sided cookie sheet,  Melt butter and margarine together in saucepan.  Add sugar, bring to boil and boil EXACTLY 3 minutes.  Spoon butter mixture over crackers, then sprinkle nuts over them.  Bake in 350 oven for EXACTLY 12 minutes and immediately spread out on waxed paper to cool.  It helps to have a helper with this last step--Pete always volunteers.  I wonder why?
