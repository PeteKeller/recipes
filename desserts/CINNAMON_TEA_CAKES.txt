CINNAMON TEA CAKES

(Balls, coated in cinnamon-sugar)
1 c (2 sticks) butter
1/2 c powdered sugar
1 t vanilla
1/8 t salt
1 t cinnamon (original recipe called for 1/2 t; I wanted more cinnamon flavor)
2 c flour
1 c chopped nuts (I use walnuts)
Coating:
1/4 c sugar
1 t cinnamon
Cream butter, add sugar and vanilla, beat until fluffy.  Add cinnamon and salt, mix well. Add in flour, then nuts, and mix well again.  Shape into 1-inch balls (I use a small ice-cream scoop.)  Bake at 325 for 14-16 minutes, until set but not brown.  Immediately remove from cookie sheets.  Cool slightly (about 3 minutes) then roll in coating mixture.  When completely cool, roll again.  ( I roll in coating right out of the oven, as with the BUTTER BALLS, and omit the second roll.)
