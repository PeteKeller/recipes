PEANUT BLOSSOMS

(Round, with a Hershey's Kiss in the middle)

1/2 c peanut butter (I like Jif)
1/2 c shortening
1/2 c sugar
1/2 c brown sugar
1/2 t salt
1 t vanilla
1 t baking soda
1 egg (large or extra large)
2 T milk
1 3/4 flour
Hershey's Kisses
additional sugar

Cream peanut butter and shortening together, then add sugars, mixing well.  Add salt, baking soda and vanilla and blend well; then add milk and egg and blend well again.  Gradually add flour.  Form into 1-inch balls, roll in sugar, and place on baking sheet, leaving room for expansion.  Bake at 375 for 7-9 minutes, push unwrapped Kiss into center of each cookie, then bake 1-3 minutes more to set.
