BUTTER TOFFEE

(like a Heath Bar)
2 1/4 cup sugar
1 t salt
1/2 c water
1 1/4 c (2 1/2 sticks) butter
1 1/2 cups chopped blanched almonds, divided
1 c finely chopped walnuts, divided
milk chocolate-book says 4 ounces, I use more like an 8 ounce  bar
In heavy 3-quart saucepan combine sugar, salt, water and butter.  Heat to boiling.  Add 3/4 c almonds and cook, stirring constantly, to hard crack stage (300-310 degrees.)  Remove from heat.  Stir in remaining 3/4 c almonds and 1/2 c walnuts, mixing only enough to combine.  VERY quickly, pour into buttered jelly roll pan (15 1/2 x 10 x 2 cookie sheet) and spread evenly.  Cool.  Spread with melted chocolate and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 c walnuts.  When cool, break into pieces.
