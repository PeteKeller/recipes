TOFFEE SQUARES

(brown sugar cookie base, chocolate coating, looks like toffee at first)
1 c (2sticks) butter
1 c firmly packed brown sugar (I usually use about 1/2 dark and 1/2 light for a richer taste, but either will work)
1 t vanilla
1/4 salt
1 egg (large or extra large)
2 c flour
16 ounces milk chocolate, melted
1/2 to 1 c chopped walnuts

Cream butter, then add brown sugar and blend until smooth.  Add salt, vanilla and egg and mix well, then gradually add flour.  Press into a 10&quot; x 15&quot; sided cookie sheet and bake at 350 for 20-25 minutes (I go for shorter baking time, since I like my cookies soft.)  Spread with melted chocolate and sprinkle with  chopped nuts.  If you want the cookies to stay soft, cut the cookies as you eat them, as opposed to cutting the whole tray at once.
