Turkey directions

This is not really a recipe, just general directions, so you will have to adapt to your tastes and size of bird.
      I usually do a 22-25 pound turkey.  Once it is safely thawed, the innards removed, and it is rinsed and dried, I stuff the cavity with onion and apple, just cut into about eighths.  I make a compound butter:  softened butter with garlic, salt, pepper, sage, paprika, marjoram, thyme, a little oregano (I usually use the jarred, minced garlic with or without some garlic powder for intensity.)  I put on some gloves and rub the butter between the skin and the meat, getting in as far as I can, in as many places as I can, without tearing the skin.  I really try to focus on the breast, as it tends to dry out the most, but I try to get everywhere to add flavor.
      I put a layer of veggies--carrots, celery, onions--roughly chopped as a base in the roaster ( I have a Rival 18 or 22 quart), then place the bird on top, breast side down, so the juices run into it.  I try to start it between 9:00 and 11:00 am at about 275 degrees.  I let it cook all day (we usually eat about 6:00), checking occasionally for moisture.  If it looks dry, I add some chicken broth or wine to the roaster.  When the turkey is done, either by thermometer or by the fact that it won't hold together anymore, I pull it out, strain the liquid into a sauce pot, bring it to a boil, and add a cold slurry of water and corn starch to thicken.  How much corn starch to use depends on how much juice and on how thick you like your gravy.
       We usually carve in the kitchen, making one platter of dark and one of light meat to take to the table.
